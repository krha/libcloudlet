Elijah: Cloudlet Infrastructure for Mobile Computing
========================================================

A cloudlet is a new architectural element that arises from the convergence of
mobile computing and cloud computing. It represents the middle tier of a 3-tier
hierarchy:  mobile device - cloudlet - cloud.   A cloudlet can be viewed as a
"data center in a box" whose  goal is to "bring the cloud closer". Please visit
